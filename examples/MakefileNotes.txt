Instructions for using the Makefile provided.
---------------------------------------------

You must already have the OpenMM binaries installed from SimTK.org/home/OpenMM. Pay careful attention to the installation 
instructions -- if you are hoping to get GPU acceleration you 
may also have to install appropriate vendor libraries and a driver.

You may need to slightly edit the Makefile to make it run on your system, depending where you installed OpenMM and the particular requirements of your version of gcc for mixed Fortran/C++ programming. There is a copy of the Makefile called 'Makefile.mac' which uses a library that worked for us on Mac.

Type "make" (or "make default") to get just one C++ example built
(HelloArgon). Make sure it runs.

To compile all example programs type "make all". That includes Fortran
examples though so you will see failures unless you have gfortran
installed. However, the C++ and C examples should compile with just
g++.

To build just one example, type "make HelloArgonInC" or whatever.

Before you run the executables, remember to add the OpenMM dynamic library directory to your library path. 

The simplest way to do this is to type the following commands:

For linux (for the bash shell, assuming installation was done in the default location: /usr/local/openmm): 
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/openmm/lib 

For MAC (for the bash shell, assuming installation was done in the default location: /usr/local/openmm):
  $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/openmm/lib
